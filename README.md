# Xaero Disabled Radar Fixer
## Blocks server-side attempts to silently disable the radar in Xaero's Minimap and World Map.

Some Minecraft servers send hidden or obfuscated chat messages that silently disable radar features in Xaero’s Minimap and World Map. This lightweight client-side mod intercepts and blocks those messages, giving you full control over your radar functionality.


**🔧 Features**

- ✅ Prevents radar-disabling messages from affecting your client
  
- 💬 Optional chat messages to notify you when blocking occurs
  
- 🔔 Optional toast notifications when the mod activates
  
- 🛠️ Fully configurable via Mod Menu + YACL (YetAnotherConfigLib)
- 
- 💾 Saves settings to a persistent .txt config file in your Minecraft config folder

**⚙️ Compatibility**

- ✔️ Works with Xaero’s Minimap and Xaero’s World Map
  
- ✔️ Minecraft 1.21 – 1.21.5
  
- ✔️ Fabric Loader only
  
- ❌ Not required on servers

**📝 Notes**

- ⚙️ You can toggle the mod on or off via Mod Menu; changes require a rejoin to take effect.
  
- ⚙️ This mod is client-side only.
  
- ❗️ While the mod does not exploit or modify servers directly, it may violate server rules that prohibit minimap radar usage. **Use at your own risk**.
